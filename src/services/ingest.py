"""Ingestion services for the portfolio report app.

This module coordinates reading PDF files and delegating to the
appropriate extractor. It exposes functions to ingest a single file and
to ingest all PDFs in a directory. It also provides a helper to
detect which extractor should handle a given file by inspecting its
